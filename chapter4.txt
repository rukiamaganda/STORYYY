Chapter 4: The Mountain Temple

After days of travel, Mycah reached the foot of the mountains. The climb was treacherous, but she pressed on, driven by the visions. At last, she found the hidden temple, its doors carved with ancient runes. The masked figure from her vision awaited her inside.

"You have come far, Mycah," the figure intoned. "But the final test remains." The temple’s halls twisted and shifted, presenting riddles and illusions. Mycah relied on her wits and the locket’s guidance to navigate the maze. At the heart of the temple, she found the crescent moon key and unlocked a chamber bathed in golden light. There, she discovered the truth of her lineage and the prophecy’s meaning: she was the guardian of a power meant to restore balance to the world.
