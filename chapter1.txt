Chapter 1: The Awakening

In the quiet village of Eldermist, a gentle dawn broke over the thatched rooftops. Mycah, a curious and spirited young woman, awoke to the sound of distant bells. Today was the day she would leave the only home she had ever known, driven by a dream she could not ignore. The villagers whispered of a prophecy, one that spoke of a child born under the blood moon who would change the fate of the world. Mycah, with a strange birthmark on her wrist, always wondered if the stories were about her.

As she packed her satchel, her grandmother pressed a silver locket into her hand. "For protection," she whispered. Mycah hugged her tightly, then stepped out into the misty morning, her heart pounding with excitement and fear. The journey ahead was uncertain, but Mycah felt a pull stronger than any she had ever known. She set off toward the forest, where her destiny awaited.
