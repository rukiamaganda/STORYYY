Chapter 2: The Forest of Whispers

The ancient forest loomed before Mycah, its trees tall and tangled, their leaves whispering secrets in the wind. As she ventured deeper, the path grew narrow and the light dimmed. Shadows danced at the edge of her vision, and the air grew thick with magic. Mycah clutched the silver locket, feeling its warmth pulse against her skin.

Suddenly, a fox with emerald eyes appeared, blocking her path. It spoke in a voice like rustling leaves: "You seek the truth, but the truth seeks you as well. Beware the river of memories." Before Mycah could respond, the fox vanished. Shaken but determined, she pressed on, guided by the cryptic warning. As dusk fell, she found herself at the edge of a shimmering river, its surface swirling with images from her past.
